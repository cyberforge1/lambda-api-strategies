# Lambda API Strategies

## Project Overview

Practical examples of four AWS Lambda strategies: sequential, concurrent, batch, and event-driven processing with SQS, showcasing efficient patterns for API and data workflows.

## MVP

- **Sequential API Calls:** Implements simple, step-by-step API calls for small datasets with low concurrency needs.
- **Concurrent API Calls:** Executes multiple API calls in parallel for faster processing of moderate datasets.
- **Batch Processing:** Handles large datasets efficiently by processing them in scalable batches.
- **Event-Driven with SQS:** Processes high-volume, asynchronous events with fault tolerance using SQS and Lambda triggers.
